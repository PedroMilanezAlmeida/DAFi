### Visual Guide On How To Use

Population that we will cluster: CD8-CD4+. Gates that we will refine with DAFi: "nonTreg", "CD45-RA, CD185 subset" among nonTregs, and "Treg".

After selecting population of interest, click on "Workspace", "plugins" and "DAFi". Select parameters for clustering among other options.

After hitting OK, the plugin runs for a few seconds (about 10-20sec for default SOM size; the first run may take a few minutes to install packages). Derived parameters and gated populations are imported back into FlowJo automatically. Please Note how the plugin ran DAFi on the whole tree down from "CD8-CD4+" (this behavior can be turned off to DAFi only the immediate children).
